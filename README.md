# ðŸ§  AI Models for Educational Assessment Research

**Evaluating open-source AI models for generating meaningful prompts that assess student competence in Python programming.**

---

## ðŸ“‹ Research Plan

### **Model Selection and Approach**

We will systematically survey open-source code-specialized Large Language Models, prioritizing those with demonstrated Python expertise and instruction-following capabilities. **Code Llama** emerges as our primary candidate, particularly the 7B-70B parameter variants with Python specialization and instruction-tuning. Code Llama achieves state-of-the-art performance among open models on code benchmarks and outperforms much larger models on Python-specific tasks. We will evaluate models based on four key criteria: (1) **code comprehension accuracy** measured against established benchmarks like HumanEval and MBPP, (2) **instruction-following ability** to generate pedagogical content rather than direct solutions, (3) **context handling** for multi-line student code analysis, and (4) **resource efficiency** considering GPU/RAM requirements for practical deployment.

### **Testing and Validation Framework**

Our validation approach centers on designing prompt templates that simulate authentic tutor-student interactions, where models receive Python exercise descriptions, student code submissions, and specific pedagogical instructions to generate hints without revealing solutions. We will create a test suite of common Python misconceptions (off-by-one errors, loop logic, variable scope issues) and evaluate whether generated prompts target the underlying conceptual gaps rather than surface-level syntax errors. **Validation metrics** include: expert rubric scores for pedagogical soundness, automated analysis of hint specificity and conceptual alignment, and simulated student improvement rates when hints are applied. We will experiment with prompt variations (Socratic questioning, constraint-based hints, progressive disclosure) and measure practical considerations including inference latency, computational costs, and failure mode frequency where models default to providing complete solutions.

## ðŸŽ¯ Reasoning and Model Analysis

### **What Makes a Model Suitable for High-Level Competence Analysis?**

A model suitable for deep competence analysis must demonstrate **semantic code understanding** beyond syntax completion, enabling it to identify conceptual misconceptions in student reasoning. The model requires strong **instruction-following capabilities** to generate pedagogical content that guides discovery rather than providing answers. **Contextual reasoning** is essentialâ€”the model must understand the educational goal, student intent, and appropriate intervention level. Finally, **consistent behavior** under pedagogical constraints ensures the model maintains its tutoring role rather than reverting to code completion.

### **Testing Meaningful Prompt Generation**

We will validate prompt quality through multi-layered evaluation: **conceptual alignment** (does the prompt address the actual misconception?), **pedagogical effectiveness** (measured by simulated student improvement), and **expert assessment** using established rubrics for educational hint quality. Automated metrics will include semantic similarity to expert-crafted questions and novelty measures to ensure prompts aren't generic. **Human evaluation** by programming educators will assess whether prompts encourage deep thinking and conceptual understanding rather than mechanical fixes.

### **Trade-offs: Accuracy, Interpretability, and Cost**

**Accuracy vs. Cost**: Larger models (Code Llama 70B) provide more nuanced, contextually appropriate hints but require 10x the computational resources of smaller variants (7B). **Interpretability vs. Performance**: All neural language models operate as black boxes, but smaller models are easier to debug and analyze for pedagogical appropriateness. **Speed vs. Quality**: Real-time educational applications demand quick responses, potentially favoring smaller models despite reduced hint sophistication. We will quantify these trade-offs by measuring "pedagogical value per compute dollar" and identifying the minimum model size that maintains educational effectiveness.

### **Model Choice Rationale**

**Code Llama (Python-specialized, Instruct variant)** is our primary evaluation target due to its demonstrated superiority on Python coding tasks, even outperforming models 10x larger in size. Its instruction-tuned design specifically targets educational scenarios where following pedagogical guidelines is crucial. **Strengths** include state-of-the-art code reasoning, open-source availability, and variants optimized for different resource constraints. **Limitations** include substantial computational requirements for larger variants and potential tendency to provide complete solutions if not carefully constrained. As a comparison baseline, we will also evaluate **CodeT5** (lighter, encoder-decoder architecture) to assess whether specialized code generation models can be adapted for educational assessment tasks.
