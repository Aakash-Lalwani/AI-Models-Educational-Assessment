## 🎯 Key Research Questions Addressed

### **1. What makes a model suitable for high-level competence analysis?**
Models must demonstrate semantic code understanding beyond syntax, strong instruction-following for pedagogical constraints, contextual reasoning for educational appropriateness, and consistent behavior under tutoring guidelines.

### **2. How to test meaningful prompt generation?**
Through conceptual alignment assessment, pedagogical effectiveness measurement via simulated student improvement, expert evaluation using educational rubrics, and automated metrics for semantic relevance and novelty.

### **3. What trade-offs exist between accuracy, interpretability, and cost?**
Larger models provide better pedagogical nuance but demand higher computational costs. Smaller models offer faster responses and easier debugging but may generate less sophisticated educational content. Real-time constraints favor efficiency while educational quality demands accuracy.

### **4. Why Code Llama and what are its strengths/limitations?**
**Choice**: Code Llama's state-of-the-art Python performance, instruction-tuned design, and open-source availability make it ideal for educational applications.

**Strengths**: Superior code reasoning, pedagogical instruction-following capability, multiple size variants for different resource constraints.

**Limitations**: High computational requirements for larger variants, potential solution revelation without careful prompting, black-box interpretability challenges.
