# üìö Detailed Research Methodology

## üéØ Model Evaluation Criteria

### **Primary Assessment Dimensions**

1. **Code Comprehension Accuracy**
   - Performance on HumanEval, MBPP, and CodeContests benchmarks
   - Ability to identify semantic vs. syntactic errors in student code
   - Understanding of Python-specific concepts (list comprehensions, generators, decorators)

2. **Pedagogical Instruction Following**
   - Adherence to "hint-only" constraints without providing solutions
   - Generation of Socratic questions that guide discovery
   - Appropriate scaffolding for different skill levels

3. **Contextual Understanding**
   - Analysis of student intent vs. implementation gaps
   - Recognition of common misconception patterns
   - Appropriate response to partial or incomplete code

4. **Resource Efficiency**
   - Inference latency for real-time educational applications
   - Memory requirements for deployment in educational settings
   - Cost-effectiveness for scaled usage

## üß™ Testing Framework

### **Sample Test Cases**

#### **Test Case 1: Logic Error (Off-by-one)**
```python
# Student's buggy code
def find_max(numbers):
    max_val = numbers[0]
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):  # BUG: Should be range(len(numbers))
        if numbers[i] > max_val:
            max_val = numbers[i]
    return max_val
```

**Expected AI Response Quality:**
- Identifies the logical issue without fixing it
- Asks probing questions about loop boundaries
- Guides student to test with edge cases

#### **Test Case 2: Conceptual Misunderstanding**
```python
# Student attempting to modify list during iteration
def remove_evens(numbers):
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            numbers.remove(num)  # BUG: Modifying list during iteration
    return numbers
```

**Expected AI Response Quality:**
- Recognizes the conceptual misconception
- Explains iteration behavior without giving the solution
- Suggests debugging strategies (print statements, step-through)

### **Evaluation Metrics**

#### **Automated Metrics**
- **Conceptual Alignment Score**: Semantic similarity between generated questions and expert-identified key concepts
- **Solution Avoidance Rate**: Percentage of responses that avoid providing direct code fixes
- **Question Specificity**: Measure of how targeted the generated prompts are to the actual bug

#### **Human Evaluation Rubric**
- **Pedagogical Soundness** (1-5 scale): Does the prompt encourage learning?
- **Conceptual Accuracy** (1-5 scale): Does it address the real issue?
- **Appropriate Difficulty** (1-5 scale): Is it suitable for the student's level?
