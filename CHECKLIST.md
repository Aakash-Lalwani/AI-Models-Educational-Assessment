# ‚úÖ Submission Checklist & Quick Reference

## üìã **Task Requirements Verification**

### ‚úÖ **Core Requirements Met:**
- [x] **Research Plan (2 paragraphs)**: ‚úÖ Provided in README.md - Model Selection & Testing Framework
- [x] **Model Evaluation**: ‚úÖ Focus on Code Llama with comprehensive criteria
- [x] **Testing Approach**: ‚úÖ Detailed validation framework with metrics
- [x] **Reasoning Documentation**: ‚úÖ Complete analysis in README.md

### ‚úÖ **Required Reasoning Questions Answered:**

#### **1. What makes a model suitable for high-level competence analysis?**
**Answer**: Semantic code understanding, instruction-following capabilities, contextual reasoning, and consistent pedagogical behavior.

#### **2. How would you test whether a model generates meaningful prompts?**
**Answer**: Multi-layered evaluation including conceptual alignment, pedagogical effectiveness measurement, expert assessment, and automated metrics for semantic relevance.

#### **3. What trade-offs might exist between accuracy, interpretability, and cost?**
**Answer**: Larger models provide better pedagogical nuance but higher computational costs. Smaller models offer faster responses but potentially less sophisticated educational content.

#### **4. Why did you choose the model you evaluated, and what are its strengths or limitations?**
**Answer**: Code Llama chosen for state-of-the-art Python performance and instruction-following. Strengths: superior code reasoning, open-source availability. Limitations: computational requirements, potential solution revelation.
